# MatchGameAngular
This is a port of *MatchGame* from JQuery to Angular.

* This app uses AngularJS version 1.5.8 with which I have a good deal of
  experience in my personal web page and more recently in a client's
  intranet web app.
* One of the neat things about Angular are *controllers*. You can easily
  have this app run multiple games simultaneously by simply making multiple
  copies of the *div* block that declares the *ng-controller* in *index.html*.
